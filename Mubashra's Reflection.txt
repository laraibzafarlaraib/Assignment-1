This was my first real experience working with a GitHub repository.
I had made one before, but it was very amateur. Thanks to the guidance I received, I learned how to use GitHub properly.
Using the shell for commands felt very professional and helped me keep track of changes easily. It made the process much more fun!
Two fun things I discovered about Git are how I can make multiple branches to make my project concise and presentable and how I can
easily collaborate with others.
					I plan to create repositories for all the work I have done before, as this will make my projects much more
useful and accessible. To maintain my GitHub account, I intend to focus on more professional projects in the future.
Overall, it was an enjoyable learning experience that I look forward to continuing!
